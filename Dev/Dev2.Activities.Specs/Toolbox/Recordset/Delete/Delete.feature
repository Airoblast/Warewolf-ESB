Scenario Outline: Deleting one recordset with two Delete tools.
	Given I have the following recordset
	| rs       | val |
	| rs().row | 1   |
	| rs().row | 2   |
	| rs().row | 3   |
	| rs().row | 4   |
	And I delete a record '<Delete1>'
   And I delete a record '<Delete2>'
	When the delete tool is executed
	And the execution has "AN" error
	Then the delete result should be "Failure"
	And the recordset "[[rs().row]]" will be as follows
	| rs       | row |
	And the execution has "AN" error
	And the debug inputs as  	
	| Records        |
	| [[rs(1).a]]  = 1 |
	And the debug output as  
	|                      |
	| [[result]] = Failure |
Examples: 
| no | delete1     | delete2 |
| 1  | [[rs(*)]]   | rs(1)]] |
| 2  | [[rs(1)]]   | rs(1)]] |
| 3  | [[rs(1).a]] | rs(1)]] |
