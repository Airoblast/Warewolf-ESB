Feature: Read File
	In order to be able to Read File
	as a Warewolf user
	I want a tool that reads the contents of a file at a given location


Scenario Outline: Read File at location
	Given I have a source path '<source>' with value '<sourceLocation>'
	And source credentials as '<username>' and '<password>'
	And result as '<resultVar>'
	When the read file tool is executed
	Then the result variable '<resultVar>' will be '<result>'
	And the execution has "<errorOccured>" error
	And the debug inputs as
         | Input Path                  | Username   | Password |
         | <source> = <sourceLocation> | <username> | String   |
	And the debug output as
		|                        |
		| <resultVar> = <result> |
	Examples: 
	| Name       | source   | sourceLocation                                                       | username               | password | resultVar       | result | errorOccured |
