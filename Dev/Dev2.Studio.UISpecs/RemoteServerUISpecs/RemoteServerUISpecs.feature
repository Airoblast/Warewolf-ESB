Feature: RemoteServerUISpecs
	In order to avoid silly mistakes
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sum of two numbers

@RemtoeServer
#Scenario: EditRemoteServerEmailPluginDBSourceDBService
#	Given I have Warewolf running
#	And all tabs are closed
#	And I create a new remote connection "RemoteUI" as
#    | Address               | AuthType | UserName | Password |
#    | http://localhost:3142 | Public   |          |          |
#	#Checking Explorer Icons
#    Then I click "EXPLORER,UI_RemoteUI (http://localhost:3142/)_AutoID"
