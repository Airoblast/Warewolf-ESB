#Scenario: ChangeWorkflowMappingsAlertsAffectedOnSave
#	Given I have Warewolf running
#	And all tabs are closed
#	And I click "EXPLORER,UI_localhost_AutoID"
#	And I send "InnerWF" to "EXPLORERFILTER"
#	And I double click "EXPLORERFOLDERS,UI_TestCategory_AutoID,UI_InnerWF_AutoID"
#	And I click "VARIABLESCALAR,UI_Variable_result_AutoID,UI_IsInputCheckbox_AutoID"
#	When I click "RIBBONSAVE"
#	Then "UI_DeleteResourceNoBtn_AutoID" is visible within "2" seconds
#	When I click "Show Affected Workflows"
#	Given I click point "95,130" on ""
#	Given I double click point "0,270" on ""
#	Then InnerWf1 should have error icon
#	And InnerWf2 should have error icon
#	And InnerWf2 should have error icon
#	And InnerWf3 should have error icon
#	And InnerWf4 should have error icon
